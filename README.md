The Wooden faces were cut from 8"x1" (lumber dimensions) Popular, planed down to the 1/2" thickness and then cut on a ShopSabre cnc router.  The "die v7.dxf" file here was used with the Vcarve Software to program the ShopSabre.

The resulting board was then cut apart; sanded; stained on the inside faces; glued together; then sanded, stained, an waxed.

The small 3D Printer plastic cube was printed from the stl file here.  The parts were scalled to make the small parts and allow all 6 sides to be printed at once.  They were then glue together to make the final cube.
